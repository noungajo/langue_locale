## Project Description

Welcome to Reenamuna, an educational and entertaining initiative designed to introduce and teach Cameroonian languages to both children and adults. These languages are essential elements of Cameroon's rich culture. Reenamuna is committed to making language learning as fun, interactive, and accessible as possible for all learners.

The project's name, "Ree Na Muna," draws inspiration from the Nufi gheu11 language, meaning "language," and the Douala Na Muna, meaning "of the child."
